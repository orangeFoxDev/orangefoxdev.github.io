## Litepapper

Using the most innovative open source technologies, we attempt to create a collective of like-minded people to better our society. Our community values trust and transparency the most, all decisions are based on voting, and from the beginning, every member can contribute to the development direction. We aim to connect people digitally and physically using mobile applications and blockchain technology. Based on anonymous data, we offer tools for blockchain technology-based services.

### Voting

Members are random sets of characters represented by their blockchain wallet address and are anonymous by default. Each wallet adds value to itself and the blockchain by voting and creating statistics on which the members themselves get rated. This way, the rating system is dynamic and depends on the voting behavior.

#### Basic vote

Members cast their vote on one of the options. Basic voting statistics generate the average popular vote - APV. It shows how often the member agrees with the majority of the vote.

#### Special vote

Members cast their vote on one of the options but can change it before the end of the voting period. Each native token in possession becomes a vote at the time of voting. The vote influence is dynamic and is recorded only at a predetermined trigger.

#### Evaluation vote

Members cast their votes only when a transaction is complete. Members and objects involved in transactions are rated separately.

##### Automatic rating

Automatic alerts warn members about the deviation based on the average value of the same object transaction. The member is also alerted to a value deviation from the average value in the selected object category.

##### Object rating

Object description fulfillment on a 100-point scale. Member rates all objects in the transaction individually after receiving them.

##### Member rating

Upon completion of the transaction, a vote is created equal to the transaction value (number of native tokens). The participating members evaluate each other on a 100-point scale. This practice benefits all by having a rating system influenced by the value and not only quantity.

Negative ratings must have evidence in case of disagreement. While in dispute, the community views the presented information and casts a rating vote. Depending on the result, value is added to or subtracted from the disputed rating.

The deviation of the overall voting average - DOVA, enforces fair assessment of other members. DOVA allows for a more accurate rating of member perceptions creating a more reliable filter system. Users have the right to see the original and the DOVA optimized rating.
