# Nameless ♻️ society

## Litepapper

Using the most innovative open source technologies, we attempt to create a collective of like-minded people to better our society. Our community values trust and transparency the most, all decisions are based on voting, and from the beginning, every user can contribute to the development. Based on anonymous data, we offer tools for blockchain technology-based services. We aim to connect people digitally and physically using mobile applications and blockchain technology.

### Voting

Users are a random set of characters represented by their blockchain wallet address and are anonymous by default. Each wallet adds value to itself and the blockchain by voting and creating statistics on which the users themselves get rated. This way, the evaluation structure is dynamic and depends on the users' evaluation behavior.

#### Simple vote

Users cast their ballots in one of the voting directions. Simple voting statistics generate the average popular vote - APV. It shows how often the user agrees with the majority of the vote.

#### Special vote

Users cast their ballots in one of the voting directions but can change it before the end of the voting period. Each native token in possession becomes a vote at the time of voting. The ballot influence is dynamic and is recorded only by collecting ⅔ of unanimous votes.

#### Evaluation vote

Users cast their ballots only when a transaction is complete. The evaluation structure rates the products and users involved in transactions separately.

##### Automatic evaluation

Automatic alerts warn users about the deviation based on the average value of the same transaction. The user is also alerted to a value deviation from the average value in the selected category.

##### Product evaluation

Evaluation of the conformity of the product/service description on a 100-point scale. Customer rates all products/services in the transaction individually after receiving the product/service.

##### User evaluation

Upon completion of the transaction, a vote is created equal to the transaction value (number of native tokens). The customer and the provider evaluate each other on a 100-point scale. This practice benefits all by having a rating system influenced by the value and not only quantity.

Negative evaluations must have comments/evidence. in case of disagreement, a public dispute notice can help defend reputation. The community evaluates the presented evidence and casts a vote during a dispute. Depending on the evaluation, value is added to or subtracted from the disputed rating.

The apparent deviation of the overall voting average - DOVA, translates correctly into the assessment of other users. The DOVA shows how much the average consumer deviates from other users in the same evaluation. The deviation allows for a more accurate assessment of consumer perceptions and a more reliable rating system. Users have the right to see the original and the DOVA optimized rating.
